About manual video tracker
-------------

This program provides a convenient interface for annotating locations in video-frames, written in python. Right now it is adapted to locating the position of ant legs, but it can easily be adapted to your needs. Since it uses a matplotlib canvas for showing the video-frames it allows to zoom into the video, allowing for a high precision in setting the locations.
